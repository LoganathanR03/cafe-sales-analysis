# ☕ Cafe Sales Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores and analyzes a dirty café sales dataset (10,000+ records) using Python.
The goal is to clean the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generate meaningful business insights that can help café owners understand their sales trends and customer preferences.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore dataset structure and identify issues

- Perform data cleaning (handling nulls, duplicates, and type conversions)

- Engineer new features for better analysis

- Generate insights on sales trends

- Visualize findings with Matplotlib & Seaborn



---

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools

- Programming Language: Python

- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Dataset: Dirty Cafe Sales Dataset (dirty_cafe_sales1.csv)

# 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

- Checked and handled missing values (filled with mode/mean where necessary)

- Removed unnecessary nulls and recalculated Total Spent as Quantity × Price Per Unit

- Converted datatypes (numeric and datetime formats)

- Verified for duplicates and removed them if present

- Created new columns → Year, Month, Weekday
